# Energy Wave Visualization

A little visualization which responds to multi-touch and click events to send energy waves. I'm aiming to get this working on coffee tables which can run web browsers and respond to touch.

Might need to use [WPF Chromium](http://wpfchromium.codeplex.com/) to get this working on Surface.
